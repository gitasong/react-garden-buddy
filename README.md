# Garden Buddy

Web app that allows the user to enter new plants into inventory and view the list of all plants and their properties, including the date added and the time since last watering. The date since last watering updates automatically with the passage of time. User should be able to click a `Water Plant` button in each entry to update the date of last watering and reset the time since last watering (not functional yet).
